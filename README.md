It provides users with list of options for their one day vacation time in Austin, TX.

#Script

The main page is linked to the script file, which looks at each checkbox provided, and if it is
checked, passes the corresponding API call (Google Maps Place API) into a Promise.all() method with 
a nested asynchronous mapping function. The mapping function returns a list of objects that each contain
an id letter and the json data from the first returned object of the API list (which provides
up to 20 objects).

The API call routes have a dynamic function that interpolates a random lat/long pair from within a 
given geo-rectangle of the city. This helps to prevent duplicate locations from appearing in the results.

The id letter of each object generated by the mapping function is then checked against the class names of the
li elements to match with the proper time of day (morning, afternoon, evening, late-night). The matched object is also
checked to see if it is a duplicate or if the li elements are already occupied by others objects' json data. 

The conditional logic is a serious limitation in that if three checkboxes in one time category (ex. morning) 
are all checked, the last option (in this case culture) will always be omitted. Potentially in the future,
I could randomize the results list order to  provide a less predictable outcome for this limitation.
